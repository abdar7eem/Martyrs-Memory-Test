# Martyrs-Memory-Test
The Java project, titled "Martyrs' Memory Test" is designed as an interactive tool to help the Palestinian people remember their martyrs based on the dates of their martyrdom. The purpose of the project is to create a memory test application using JavaFX, applying event-driven programming concepts. The program presents a list of martyr names and asks users to input two names. The application then checks if the names are in the correct order based on the date of martyrdom. The user is provided feedback based on their input, including success or error messages. Additionally, a combo box allows users to change the interface color for customization.

The project utilizes core object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Java, such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. The Martyr class represents individual martyrs with attributes like name and date of martyrdom. This class encapsulates data with getter and setter methods. Inheritance allows classes like MemoryTest to build on existing structures, while polymorphism is used to modify behaviors, like customizing the interface theme based on user preferences, ensuring dynamic responses based on different inputs.
